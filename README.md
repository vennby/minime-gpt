<h3> TLDR; What is <b>MinimēGPT</b>?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An isolated writing environment that does not allow for AI interference.</li>
  <li>A software for all your writing, and <i>only</i> your writing.</li>
</ul>

### Why'd I build it?
<p align="justify"> 
  I remember when I was a student juggling multiple assignments and tasks at the same time, and I remember being able to get it all done. I remember the feelings of pure joy and the surge of self-trust and confidence that came from being able to handle everything myself, without needing help, ever. Now, I see over-reliance on a glorified statistical word-predictor, one that causes diminished critical thinking skills and academic dishonesty, and I felt like I had to do something about it.

### How to run it?

1. Clone the repo, download it, do whatever you'd like to set it up in your code editor.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vennby/minime-gpt.git
    cd easy-cv
    ```

2. Then, simply run this to first install the necessary libraries all at once.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Since this is a Flask application, this command should do the job.

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
